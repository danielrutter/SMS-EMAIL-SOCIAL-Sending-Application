SMS-EMAIL-SOCIAL-Sending-Application - DESCRIPTION(S) - 3rd June 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a SMS/EMAIL/SOCIAL Sending Application created under the MIT Licence for the purpose of providing a template/service for larger projects which involve Sending Data through SMS, EMAIL & Social Media.

The first edition of this application was created (with possible early collaborators being hinted at this stage for future development) by Daniel William Rutter at danielrutter.com, with potential to collaborate with others after some backend work is complete in order to give a basic outline of what to expect in the future of this application.
